This project implements a Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher, to encrypt a plaintext message with a specified key. The code takes a key as a command-line argument and encrypts the plaintext word by word, shifting each letter of the plaintext forward or backward in the ASCII table by the key.

Detailed explanation of the code:

Checking command-line arguments:
The code starts by checking that two command-line arguments were provided. If fewer than two arguments are provided, an error message is printed and the program is terminated.

Getting the plaintext:
The code gets the plaintext from the user using the get_string function from cs50. The plaintext is stored in the sentence variable.

Converting the key to an integer:
The code converts the key, which is a string value, to an integer using the atoi function from stdlib.h. The integer value of the key is stored in the argc1 variable.

Encrypting the plaintext:
The code iterates through each character of the plaintext, using a for loop. For each character, the code performs the following operations:

If the character is a space, a space is printed.
If the character is an uppercase letter, the ASCII value of the letter is calculated and shifted forward or backward in the ASCII table by the key. The new ASCII value is converted back to a character and printed.
If the character is a lowercase letter, the ASCII value of the letter is calculated and shifted forward or backward in the ASCII table by the key. The new ASCII value is converted back to a character and printed.
If the character is another type of character, it is printed directly.
Printing the result:
The code prints the phrase "ciphertext: " before printing the encrypted text. Finally, the code prints a newline (\n) to separate the plaintext from the ciphertext.

The code implements the Caesar cipher in a simple and practical way, providing a foundation for understanding the basic principles of substitution ciphers.
